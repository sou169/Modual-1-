/*Q-OOP vs POP

A: 

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) treats data as a critical element in program development. 
It emphasizes data over procedures.
In OOP, objects and classes play a central role. 
Objects represent real-world entities, while classes define blueprints for creating those objects. 
Each class encapsulates data (properties) and behavior (methods). 
OOP promotes code reusability through mechanisms like inheritance (where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class) and composition (combining multiple classes to create more complex ones).

On the other hand, Procedural Programming (POP) focuses on procedures or functions. 
It structures code around a sequence of steps needed to achieve a specific task. 
POP uses global variables and functions, allowing data to flow freely across functions. 
While POP is simpler and straightforward for small-scale programs, it can become unwieldy as projects grow. 
Code reusability is limited in POP, as functions are typically standalone.

In summary, 
OOP emphasizes objects, classes, and encapsulation, promoting code reusability and maintainability. 
POP relies on procedures, global data, and sequential execution. 
The choice between OOP and POP depends on project requirements and developer preferences .
