//Q:What is OOP? List OOP concepts.

//A:
/*Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming that aims to implement real-world entities and features in code. Here are the key OOP concepts:

1.Class: A class is a user-defined data type that represents a blueprint for creating objects. It defines data members (properties) and member functions (methods) that can be accessed by creating instances of the class. For example, a "Car" class might have properties like wheels, speed limits, and mileage.
2.Object: An object is an instance of a class. When a class is instantiated, memory is allocated for an object. Objects have identity, state, and behavior. For instance, a "Dog" object could have characteristics like color, breed, and behaviors like barking and sleeping.
3.Data Abstraction: Abstraction provides essential information about data while hiding implementation details. Think of a car driver who knows how to accelerate and brake without understanding the inner workings of the car.
4.Encapsulation: Encapsulation wraps data and code into a single unit. It hides class variables from other classes, allowing access only through member functions. This concept ensures data security and maintains code integrity.
5.Inheritance: Inheritance allows a new class (the derived or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (the base or parent class). It promotes code reusability and hierarchy.
6.Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated uniformly. It allows method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) and method overriding (redefining a method in a derived class).
